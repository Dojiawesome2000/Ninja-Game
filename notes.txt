Notes:
- For pygame coordinate system, (0,0) is at TOP LEFT of screen
- Layering of images is based entirely on the order you place them on a surface




- For creation of pygame:
    - Init pygame
    - Create screen
    - Create clock/timer for frame rate
    - Create game loop:
        - update imgs/surfaces
        - other logic (e.g. update assets, update phsyics entities)
        - Detect exit key
        - Detect other keybinds

        - update screen
        - update clock
    - (ensure game loop is instantiated)
